        <p>
          I am a dedicated software engineer specialising in back-end
          development with full-stack proficiency. I have been using Ruby for
          the last 15+ years, and Ruby on Rails and TypeScript for the last 6
          years, while working at Zendesk in Copenhagen. My go-to tech stack for
          home projects these days is TypeScript with React.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love producing quality, secure, maintainable code, and taking
          ownership all the way from conception to production to eventual
          decommissioning. I love sharing whatever I have learnt with those
          around me, and learning from them.
        </p>
