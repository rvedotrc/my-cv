        <p>
          Over the last 15+ years I have a proven track record of bringing
          expertise, leadership, and mentoring to the teams I work with, first
          at the BBC in London, and subsequently at Zendesk in Copenhagen. I
          work with others to design and build solid, secure, performant
          systems, taking care of the whole lifecycle from conception to
          decommissioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my 5+ years at Zendesk, I used Datadog extensively, in
          particular as a maintainer of Zendesk's in-house IaC tool for Datadog.
          I have always had a strong interest in reliability, performance, and
          security, and I love learning from others, and sharing what I know.
        </p>
