        <p>
          I am a dedicated software engineer specialising in back-end
          development with full-stack proficiency. My time at the BBC and at
          Zendesk has given me 6 years TypeScript experience, 13 years with AWS
          and Ruby, and (on and off) 15 years with Python, while working with
          cloud systems, event-based processing, high-volume web services, and
          so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love producing quality, secure, maintainable code, and taking
          ownership all the way from conception to production to eventual
          decommissioning. I love sharing whatever I have learnt with those
          around me, and learning from them.
        </p>
