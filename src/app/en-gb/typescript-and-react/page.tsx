        <p>
          I am a dedicated software engineer specialising in back-end
          development with full-stack proficiency. Since I was introduced to
          TypeScript and React in 2019 it has become my go-to stack for many of
          my projects. I also have many years experience with Ruby, Java, AWS,
          and various relational databases including Postgres, which I have been
          using since 2001.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love producing quality, secure, maintainable code, and taking
          ownership all the way from conception to production to eventual
          decommissioning. I love sharing whatever I have learnt with those
          around me, and learning from them.
        </p>
