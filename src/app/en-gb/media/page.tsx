        <p>
          I am a dedicated software engineer specialising in back-end
          development with full-stack proficiency. For 11 years I worked at the
          BBC in London, where my team was responsible for all of the BBC's
          online audio and video, including BBC iPlayer. In 2013 we remade the
          entire media processing system to be cloud-native: ingest, transcode,
          metadata update.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love producing quality, secure, maintainable code, and taking
          ownership all the way from conception to production to eventual
          decommissioning. As well as learning from others, I love mentoring
          those around me, using my experience to build up the whole team.
