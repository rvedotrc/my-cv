        <p>
          I am a dedicated software engineer specialising in back-end
          development with full-stack proficiency. For 8 years while at the BBC,
          Java was my team's primary language for production code, as we
          designed and built the BBC's online audio/video processing and
          publication platform from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love producing quality, secure, maintainable code, and taking
          ownership all the way from conception to production to eventual
          decommissioning. As well as learning from others, I love mentoring
          those around me, using my experience to build up the whole team.
        </p>
